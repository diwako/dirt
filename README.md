Applies texture layers dynamically to units in Arma 3

# D.I.R.T.

Diwako's Immersive Realtime Textures is an Arma3 modification which adds dynamic texture layers onto uniform and backpack textures.
It is using Arma's UI2Texture feature as a base and displays the textures with a smooth transition.

As the UI2Texture feature uses up a lot of VRAM of a GPU, this mod is optimizied to only allow a variable amount of these dynamic textures, all confugrable within the "Addon Options" menu. It is trimmed to re-use dynamic texture canvases and just display the needed textures from a object to object basis.

Currently there are several effects added:

- Dirt
- Snow
- Rain
- Snowfall
- Burn/Scorching texture (ACE Fire support)

This mod is also a framework to add more texture layers via compat mods or even through a mission's descriptin.ext. For this please check the [wiki on this GitHub repository](https://github.com/diwako/dirt/wiki).
